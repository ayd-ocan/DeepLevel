# DeepLevel
DeepLevel is created for predicting mobile traffic level using Deep Learning.Dataset includes 7 days mobile traffic activity of Milan in 2013.

Project is executed part to part.It includes analysis of data,preprocessing,neural network architecture and results.
The model is trained for 2 ways : 
1) For each day (Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday ...)
2) For sum of all days in once.

The detailed paper which includes data analysis and deep learning architecture can be seen in in files.
